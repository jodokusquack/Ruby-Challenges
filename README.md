## Ruby Challenges from The Odin Project

If you are interested check out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks). 
A free curriculum for learning web development.

These three challenges are designed to get familiar with the Ruby
Language. Tests for the individual methods were added afterwards when I
continued in the Odin Project path.
